## Description

After installing this mod, you will be able to see the avatars of characters in social box. The character's expression will change depending on the perception of the PC. Some characters have different looks depending on gender and style.

The game does not give the specific appearance of the character, the mod is just a fanart, please do not mistake it for official appearances.

The mod (including pictures and codes) are freely used within the scope of DoL, and can be modified or reproduced. If you want to do a similar feature, that's fine, don't ask me. If you want to change or integrate, keep the "Image Instructions(图像说明)" section, or note it elsewhere in the game.

> Image Instructions: You have used the NPC Avatars Mod. This mod is just a fanart. The game does not give the specific appearance of characters, please do not mistake it for the official appearance.

### Tips

<details>

**<summary>SPOILER</summary>**

- You can summon Ivory Wraith, or incarnations of the makers, in the poster in your bedroom.
- Just as they actually show it, Eden on the social box can get restless if you've been gone too long.
- When Mickey shows up next to Landry, it indicates that they can see you now (for pub fame mission).
